This is my first Linear Regression Project using R Program.
I have used linear regression to predict salaries of people based on the Years of Experience. 
The code is in the "RCode.R" file, where as the data is in the "Predicting_Salaries.csv" file.
I have added comments wherever necessary. Thank you and happy learning!
